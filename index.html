            <p>
              <span>STEP 2- CONTACT:</span> Complete the questionnaire on our
              website so we can gather more details about your business to
              determine how the content on your website will look.
              Alternatively, you can send us a text with a bit about your
              business. I have a fear of phone calls, however if you insist, we
              can schedule a call through text.

              <span>STEP 3- DEPOSIT & CONTRACT:</span> Yumsah’s will provide a
              month-month contract agreement. If you agree to it, we will start
              designing your website; which can take anywhere between 5-14 days.
              The first month will be paid for upfront & the second month starts
              6 weeks after the deposit was made. The quicker the responses, the
              more free website hosting you receive!

              <span>STEP 4- COPYWRITING:</span> At this stage, you will need to
              start writing ideas for what you want on your website. This
              includes writing paragraphs about the services you provide or
              about your business. Yumsah’s can provide some help, however you
              know about your business and the services you provide the most.
              Grammar and sentence structure does not matter, you can send
              whatever information you can and we can rewrite it for you so it
              looks professional.

            <p>
              <span>STEP 5- REVISIONS:</span> Your website’s first draft is
              finished! Some sections may have text or image holders. We will
              provide a temporary link to your website so you can decide what
              needs to be added, changed or removed. This can be colors, design,
              sections, buttons, text size/font,etc.

            <i class="fa-solid fa-bolt"></i>
            <p>
              <span>STEP 6- WEBSITE DEPLOYMENT:</span> After multiple revisions,
              we will arrive at the final and best version of your website.
              Congratulations, your website is up and ready for business! We
              would really appreciate a Google review here (link to google
              profile) to help us succeed and bring other small businesses up
              with us!

              Yumsah’s Website Design strives to provide the best work possible.
              It is possible for the designer and the client to have different
              opinions on a piece of work. Website design is a very tedious
              process; it can be an extremely long process as a designer. A
              deposit will be required before we start the work. Before
              submitting your deposit, make sure you check out our portfolio so
              you have an idea of the quality of our work. In the case that
              there is a disagreement on the work quality and the client
              requests a refund, the owner of Yumsah’s will decide if the work
              does not meet the quality of our service. If the work meets the
              quality we provide as seen in our portfolio, no refund will be
              issued as many hours have already been spent designing. The client
              will have to come to an agreement on how they want the website
              changed. Any purposeful excessive changes will be denied.
